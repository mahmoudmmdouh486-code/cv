# Mahmoud Mmdouh Abdelfattah Mohamed - CV

This repository contains my CV designed in a C# code style.  
The CV presents my background, skills, education, certifications, projects, and experiences in a creative programming-themed format.

## How to view the CV website

The CV website is located in the `cv-website` folder.

### To view locally

Open the file `cv-website/index.html` in a web browser.

### To view online (GitHub Pages)

1. Go to the repository Settings > Pages.
2. Under "Source", select the branch `master` and folder `/ (root)` or `/cv-website` if you want to serve from that folder.
3. Save the settings.
4. The site will be published at:  
   `https://mahmoudmmdouh486-code.github.io/cv/`  
   or if served from the root folder:  
   `https://mahmoudmmdouh486-code.github.io/`

Make sure the files are in the root or the selected folder for GitHub Pages to serve correctly.

If you get a 404 error, check that the GitHub Pages source branch and folder are set correctly and that the files are pushed to that branch.
